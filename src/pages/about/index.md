Janique-ka John was born and raised in St.Vincent and the Grenadines, where she first fell in love with computers and computing. During her bachelor's degree at the University of the West Indies Cave Hill she discovered her love for programming and went on to pursue a Masters Degree in Applied Computer Science. She has been working in Brussels as a Software Engineer for the past 3.5 years and is the Founder of the Women in Tech Caribbean Community.

### Founder of Women in Tech Caribbean

Janique-ka founded Women in Tech Caribbean in 2019 after realising a need for an easy way to share opportunities, job offers and scholarships with more Caribbean Women in the Tech space. She subsequently reached out to Co-Founder Sherezz with the idea, and they both launched a campaign to get the groupp off the ground. The Slack-based group now has over 180 members, and they meet every month to network and get to know each other better.

### Passionate about problem solving for the Caribbean
